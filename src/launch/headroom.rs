//! Centralized memory-headroom policy.
//!
//! The budget authority (admission control) and the refusal messages it
//! produces are the *only* consumers. Every display surface — `status`,
//! the TUI host pane, the doctor hardware section, the init banner —
//! shows raw totals; the post-headroom number appears only when
//! admission refuses or degrades a launch and needs to explain why.
//!
//! Two questions live here so they have exactly one answer:
//!
//! 1. **Usable fraction** of a pool's raw total: how much can be handed
//!    to a model before the OS and other resident consumers are
//!    starved. Apple's unified pool keeps the historical `0.75` (moved
//!    here unchanged from `aggregate_vram_bytes`). An AMD/Intel
//!    integrated UMA pool and a discrete VRAM pool are budgeted at the
//!    full total and lean on the overhead band below for their margin —
//!    we do not invent an unmeasured fraction for them.
//! 2. **Fixed overhead band** per GPU backend: bytes a successful load
//!    consumes beyond `weights + KV cache` (compute buffers, driver-side
//!    allocations the GGUF header can't predict). Values are the
//!    conservative defaults from `docs/spikes/2026-05-19-vram-overhead-band.md`;
//!    the spike marks them unverified, so the stance is "err high" and
//!    they must not be silently tightened.
