"""Trim an asciinema v2 cast: clamp idle gaps and optionally rescale time.

The harness records a cast in real time, so it carries every pause the driven
session sat through — a model loading, a smoke probe, a `wait:` we left
generous. This rewrites the inter-event deltas so long pauses collapse to a
readable beat while the typing/animation cadence is preserved.

  python3 scripts/tui/trim_cast.py in.cast out.cast \
      [--max-gap 1.2] [--speed 1.0] [--hold T:DUR ...]

--max-gap S   clamp any gap between two output events to at most S seconds
              (default 1.2). This is what kills the dead air.
--speed F     divide every (already-clamped) delta by F; >1 is faster
              (default 1.0, i.e. unchanged).
--hold T:DUR  freeze on the frame at (or just after) raw timestamp T for an
              extra DUR seconds — let a payoff frame breathe (e.g. the init
              summary) without slowing the rest. Repeatable.
--end T       drop every event after raw timestamp T (trim a ragged tail, e.g.
              a stray quit). Default: keep everything.
--band LO:HI  even out the cadence: leave sub-frame repaint bursts (gaps under
              BURST seconds) untouched, but clamp every *pause between actions*
              into [LO, HI] — long waits collapse to HI, abrupt jumps stretch to
              LO — so the whole clip plays at one steady rate. Applied after
              --max-gap/--speed, before --hold. Default: off.

The header is copied verbatim (width/height/theme/env preserved); only the
event timestamps are rewritten, monotonically from 0.
